    {
      "question": "How many Life Points (LP) does each player start with?",
      "answer": "Each player starts a duel with 8000 Life Points."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the three main components of a player's deck?",
      "answer": "A player's deck is composed of a Main Deck (40 to 60 cards), an Extra Deck (0 to 15 cards), and a Side Deck (0 to 15 cards)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many copies of the same card can be included in a deck?",
      "answer": "Players can include up to 3 copies of the same card across their Main Deck, Extra Deck, and Side Deck combined, unless a card is Forbidden, Limited, or Semi-Limited."

      "answer": "The Game Mat organizes the play area into specific zones such as the Main Monster Zone, Spell & Trap Zone, Pendulum Zone, Graveyard, Deck, Extra Deck, and Field Zone, ensuring that cards are placed and tracked correctly during a duel."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does a Normal Summon work?",
      "answer": "A Normal Summon involves playing a Monster Card from your hand in face-up Attack Position onto the field. This action can be performed only once per turn (or once as a Normal Set)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Normal Set?",
      "answer": "A Normal Set refers to placing a Monster Card face-down on the field. A monster that is Set is not considered to have been Summoned, and it can later be flipped face-up via a Flip Summon or by a card effect."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Tribute Summon and when is it required?",
      "answer": "A Tribute Summon is required for summoning monsters that are Level 5 or higher. Level 5 or 6 monsters require one tribute, while Level 7 or higher monsters require two tributes, where a tribute means sending one or more monsters you control to the Graveyard."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Flip Summon?",
      "answer": "A Flip Summon occurs when a face-down Set monster is flipped into face-up Attack Position. Note that a monster cannot be Flip Summoned in the same turn it was Set."

      "answer": "Special Summons refer to methods of summoning monsters using card effects, such as Pendulum Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, Fusion Summons, Ritual Summons, and Link Summons. They usually do not count as a Normal Summon and can occur multiple times per turn if conditions are met."
    },
    {
      "question": "What distinguishes Normal Monsters from Effect Monsters?",
      "answer": "Normal Monsters do not have any special effects and rely solely on their ATK and DEF values. In contrast, Effect Monsters have additional abilities and card text that can influence gameplay."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do Xyz Monsters differ from other monsters?",
      "answer": "Xyz Monsters have a Rank instead of a Level and are summoned using face-up monsters of the same Level as Xyz Materials. They start in the Extra Deck and are Special Summoned onto the field by stacking the required materials."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the process for performing an Xyz Summon?",
      "answer": "To perform an Xyz Summon, choose an Xyz Monster from your Extra Deck that matches the Levels of your face-up monsters. Then, stack the appropriate monsters as Xyz Materials and Special Summon the Xyz Monster onto the Extra Monster Zone."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Synchro Monsters and how are they summoned?",
      "answer": "Synchro Monsters are Special Summoned from the Extra Deck by sending 1 face-up Tuner monster along with one or more non-Tuner monsters from your field to the Graveyard, where the sum of their Levels equals the Level of the Synchro Monster."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does a Fusion Summon work?",
      "answer": "A Fusion Summon is performed by using a Fusion Spell Card, such as Polymerization, along with the specific Fusion Materials listed on the Fusion Monster card. The Fusion Materials are sent to the Graveyard, and then the Fusion Monster is Special Summoned from the Extra Deck."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Ritual Summon?",
      "answer": "A Ritual Summon involves using a Ritual Spell Card along with the corresponding Ritual Monster and the necessary Tribute. After paying the required cost by sending the tributed monsters to the Graveyard, the Ritual Monster is Summoned from your hand or field."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Pendulum Monsters and how are they used?",
      "answer": "Pendulum Monsters are unique because they function as both Monsters and Spell Cards. They can be placed in the Pendulum Zones and have a Pendulum Scale, which determines the range of Levels for monsters that can be Special Summoned via a Pendulum Summon."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Link Monster and what role does it play?",
      "answer": "Link Monsters are summoned from the Extra Deck and use other monsters as Link Materials. They have Link Arrows that determine which zones can be used to summon additional monsters from the Extra Deck, thereby expanding your field presence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the Extra Deck?",
      "answer": "The Extra Deck is a separate collection of cards that includes Xyz, Synchro, Fusion, Ritual, and Link Monsters. These cards are not counted towards the Main Deck's 40-card minimum and have their own summoning conditions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the phases of a duel turn?",
      "answer": "A duel turn is divided into several phases: Draw Phase, Standby Phase, Main Phase 1, Battle Phase, Main Phase 2, and End Phase."
    },
    {
      "question": "What occurs during the Draw Phase?",
      "answer": "During the Draw Phase, the turn player draws 1 card from their Deck. However, the first player in the very first turn of a duel does not draw a card during this phase."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Standby Phase?",
      "answer": "In the Standby Phase, players resolve any card effects or costs that must occur at the beginning of the turn. This phase is also an opportunity to activate effects before moving on to the Main Phase."
    },
    {
      "question": "What actions are allowed during Main Phase 1?",
      "answer": "During Main Phase 1, players can Summon or Set monsters, change battle positions of monsters (subject to certain restrictions), activate Spell and Trap cards, and prepare for the upcoming Battle Phase."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the key steps in the Battle Phase?",
      "answer": "The Battle Phase is divided into several steps: the Start Step (declaring an attack), the Battle Step (calculating battle outcomes), and the Damage Step (applying battle damage). After resolving these steps, the phase ends when the player declares no more attacks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if a monster attacks directly?",
      "answer": "If a player attacks directly (when the opponent has no monsters on the field), the full ATK value of the attacking monster is subtracted from the opponent’s LP as battle damage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What occurs during Main Phase 2?",
      "answer": "Main Phase 2 allows players to perform similar actions as in Main Phase 1 (such as Summoning, activating card effects, and setting Spell & Trap cards) to further adjust their field after the Battle Phase."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the End Phase?",
      "answer": "During the End Phase, players resolve any card effects that activate at the end of a turn. Additionally, if a player has more than 6 cards in hand, they must discard down to 6 cards."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a Chain in the context of the game?",
      "answer": "A Chain is a sequence of card effects activated in response to one another. Each effect is added to the Chain and then resolved in reverse order, starting with the last effect added."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Spell Speed and what are its levels?",
      "answer": "Spell Speed determines when a card effect can be activated in relation to other effects. There are three levels: Spell Speed 1 (cannot be chained), Spell Speed 2 (can be chained to lower speeds), and Spell Speed 3 (the fastest and can respond to lower or equal speeds)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are Quick-Play Spell Cards different from Normal Spell Cards?",
      "answer": "Quick-Play Spell Cards can be activated during any phase of a turn (even during the opponent's turn if they were Set previously), whereas Normal Spell Cards are generally activated during the player's Main Phase and have single-use effects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Equip Spell Cards and how do they function?",
      "answer": "Equip Spell Cards attach to a specific monster, granting it additional effects or boosting its ATK/DEF. They occupy a Spell & Trap Zone and remain on the field as long as the equipped monster is present; if that monster leaves the field, the Equip Spell Card is sent to the Graveyard."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the function of Field Spell Cards?",
      "answer": "Field Spell Cards are placed in the Field Zone and have effects that generally apply to both players. Only one Field Spell Card can be active on a player's side of the field at any given time."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do Continuous Spell and Trap Cards work?",
      "answer": "Continuous Spell and Trap Cards remain face-up on the field after their activation. Their effects persist as long as they remain on the field, but they can be destroyed or negated by the opponent’s actions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Counter Trap Cards and when can they be activated?",
      "answer": "Counter Trap Cards are designed to respond to the activation of other card effects. They require a higher Spell Speed (usually Spell Speed 3) and are activated in response to an opponent’s card effect to negate or counter it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Side Deck in a duel?",
      "answer": "The Side Deck is used to customize your strategy between duels within a match. After each duel, players can swap cards between their Main/Extra Deck and Side Deck, keeping the Side Deck’s card count constant (up to 15 cards)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Forbidden, Limited, and Semi-Limited cards?",
      "answer": "Forbidden cards are not allowed in decks, Limited cards can only be included as a single copy, and Semi-Limited cards can be included as two copies in a deck. These restrictions are updated regularly for tournament play."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are Monster Tokens and how are they used?",
      "answer": "Monster Tokens are representations of monsters created by card effects. They occupy a Monster Zone and are treated as Normal Monsters; however, they cannot be used as materials for an Xyz Summon."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is battle damage calculated when attacking an Attack Position monster?",
      "answer": "When attacking an Attack Position monster, the attacking monster’s ATK is compared to the defending monster’s ATK. If the attacker’s ATK is higher, the difference is subtracted from the opponent’s LP; if equal, neither monster is destroyed; if lower, the attacking monster is destroyed and the difference is subtracted from your LP."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is battle damage calculated when attacking a Defense Position monster?",
      "answer": "When attacking a Defense Position monster, the attacking monster’s ATK is compared to the defending monster’s DEF. If the attacker’s ATK is higher, the defending monster is destroyed and no battle damage is inflicted; if lower, the difference is subtracted from your LP; if equal, nothing happens."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of card positions (face-up/face-down, Attack/Defense)?",
      "answer": "Card positions indicate how a monster or card is used during play. For example, a face-up monster can activate its effects, while a face-down monster cannot. Attack or Defense positions also affect battle calculations, such as ATK vs. ATK or ATK vs. DEF comparisons."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does it mean to change a monster’s battle position, and what are the restrictions?",
      "answer": "Changing a monster’s battle position means switching between face-up Attack Position, face-up Defense Position, or face-down Defense Position. Restrictions include: a monster cannot change its battle position the same turn it was Summoned, cannot be changed in Main Phase 2 if it attacked during the Battle Phase, and can only have its battle position changed once per turn."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is meant by the term 'Priority' in a duel?",
      "answer": "Priority refers to the right of a player to activate a card or effect at a given time. The turn player initially holds Priority, and once they pass it, the opponent can activate effects until Priority is passed back."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is Priority passed between players during a turn?",
      "answer": "After activating a card or effect, the player must pass Priority to their opponent. Additionally, when moving between phases or steps, Priority is automatically passed if no further actions are declared."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the significance of the Graveyard in gameplay?",
      "answer": "The Graveyard is a public zone where destroyed, used, or discarded cards are placed. Both players can view the Graveyard contents, and certain card effects may target cards in the Graveyard for revival or other actions."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does it mean for a card to be 'banished'?",
      "answer": "Banished cards are removed from the field and are not used in normal gameplay, though some effects can later retrieve them. Banished cards are set aside and do not return to the hand, Deck, or Graveyard unless an effect specifies otherwise."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do card effects that require a cost function?",
      "answer": "Card effects often have a cost that must be paid before the effect can be activated. This may include tributing a monster, discarding a card, or paying Life Points. Costs must be paid in full before the effect is put on the Chain."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if two or more effects activate simultaneously?",
      "answer": "When multiple effects activate simultaneously, the turn player’s effects are placed on the Chain first, followed by the opponent’s. The effects then resolve in reverse order of activation."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the role of the Glossary in the rulebook?",
      "answer": "The Glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the rulebook, such as 'Tribute', 'Flip Summon', 'Equip Card', and 'Battle Damage', ensuring that players understand the terminology used in the game."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can players find further official information or updates on the game rules?",
